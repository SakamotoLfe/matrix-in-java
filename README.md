# matrix-in-java

Created this project cause I'm tired of companies asking me for simple Matrix questions, a technology that I NEVER used in my professional life but still they're asking, so I'll just send this project to them saying "I once knew but now I don't know anymore cause no one fucking use this shit anymore. I'll stop reinventing the wheel, thank you."

I'll update this project as questions appears...
